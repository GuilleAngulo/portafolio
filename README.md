# Personal Portafolio

This is a Personal Portafolio MEAN Stack application. The menu is composed by: "Sobre Mi" (About Me), "Proyectos (Projects)", "Crear Proyecto" (Create Project) and "Contacto" (Contact).
In the "About Me" section there is a personal introduction template. In "Projects" are displayed th projects stored at the MongoDB, where you can delete or edit its properties. 
In "Create Project" there is a form to create a new project, allowing to attach one picture to it. Finally in "Contact" section you can fill a form which will create and send an email.
